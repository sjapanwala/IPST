# Internet Protocol Search Tool  - (IPST)
##### Written By Saaim Japanwala

### Description
#### Internet Protocol Search Tool (IPST) is a searching tool that utilizes the internet protocol address (IP Address) and harnesses information that is available and stored in the IP address. A relatively harmless tool and mainly to be used in network development and sometimes cyber security. This tool is a new and devloped version of the IPTOOL that I have made a while back, but with alot more features and updates. This tool will be constantly developed and wont require a new download  everytime a new update is released, but will only require a simple command in your command prompt.

### Features And Usese.
- IP Search #1 - Uses IPV4 only. If you have an IPV6 address, you are unable to use this function. This IP search is very generalized and dosent give lots of ourput information.'
- IP Search #2 - Uses Either IPV4 or IPV6. This function can utilize both IP formats and outputs alot more information. This function is more useful in terms of information and is versitile in different formats.
- Geolocation - Uses Longitide and Latitudes to locate the continent information of the IP, shows you a graphic of which continent the IP is located in. (Note, This feature does not have support for all continents.) (Current Support [North America, Some of Europe, Oceana, Some of Asia])
