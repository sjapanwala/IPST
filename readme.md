### Description
#### Internet Protocol Search Tool (IPST) is a searching tool that utilizes the internet protocol address (IP Address) and harnesses information that is available and stored in the IP address. A relatively harmless tool and mainly to be used in network development and sometimes cyber security. This tool is a new and devloped version of the IPTOOL that I have made a while back, but with alot more features and updates. This tool will be constantly developed and wont require a new download  everytime a new update is released, but will only require a simple command in your command prompt.
